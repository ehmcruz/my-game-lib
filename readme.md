# My Game Library

Still in very early development process.

# Overall dependencies

To compile, you need a C++23 capable compiler and the following libraries:

- SDL
- My-lib (https://github.com/ehmcruz/my-lib). The Makefile is configured to search **my-lib** in the same parent folder as this repository. If you put somewhere else, just modify the Makefile.

# Downloading assets - TEST software

I don't like to store assets in GitHub.
So download them from my drive:

**https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZQbGIG8qmx9LmMmOhzW2FlCmDj3M9Q_2?usp=sharing**

Just put the tests-assets folder in project's root directory.
